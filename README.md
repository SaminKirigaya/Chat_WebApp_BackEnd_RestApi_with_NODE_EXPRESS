## Optimizations

The most important thing which you must remember is that you have to change .env file and adjust it according to your hosting.I ran the project in localhost in port 8000.

- PORT=8000
- SMTP_MAIL= {Must add ur smtp mail here}
- SMTP_PASS= {Must add smtp mails google provided pass}
- IMG=http://localhost:8000
- DBURL=mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/chatserver


-   Port means which port to run it.
-   Imgpath is a link starting root address ... I used express.static to save image inside public/images.
so the image link was like :
http://localhost:8000/public/images/imagename.jpg


-   smtp_mail and smtp_pass are your smtp creation provided one.

- Change DBURL's mongo db urls if you host in mongo atlas.
